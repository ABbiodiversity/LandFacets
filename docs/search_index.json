SDMs created using the vegetation layer are often robust and show expected relationships between species and their habitats. However, SDMs based on the soils layer often have flat relationships across soil classes (e.g., Tortula acaulon) or have relationships that are challenging to interpret (e.g., Red-winged blackbird in thin break soils). This is, in part, related to the accuracy of soil information at sites where biological data is collected due to the complex soil polygon layer. As a result, we have begun exploring alternatives to the soils layer in hopes of identifying biologically relevant species-habitat relationships. 1.1 Acknowledgement We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of the past and present ABMI staff. Without our field staff, geospatial experts, taxonomists, and ecologists, we would not be able to perform this work. 1.2 Suggested citation Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. 2022.

"],["methods.html", "2 Methods", " 2 Methods As a potential alternative to the soils layer, we explored Scott Nielsens Land facets of Alberta for modelling species-habitat relationships. This layer uses information on solar radiation, terrain wetness, and provincial soil and geological data to classify unique land facets. Using this layer, as well as the sub-layers used to create it, we explored three alternative land cover layers: First, we used the composite classification system designed by Scott (land facet model). This layer is composed of 16 categories, 10 of which have been sampled at ABMI sites within the southern analysis region. The majority (~85%, and additional 4.5% being water) of our surveyed sites fall within the flat dry, flat mesic, and flat wet categories (i.e., the sites reflect heterogeneity along wetness gradient). The number of equivalent quadrants surveyed for the 9 landcover types and water class defined in the land facet layer. The second alternative layer was the terrain sub-model (terrain model). This is a simplified version of the land facet model where both the saline and dunes categories have been removed. By removing these two categories, we are able to use land facet classes which are derived from a consistent source (solar radiation and terrain wetness). The current sampling effort of these categories at ABMI sites is dominated by the flat dry, flat mesic, and flat wet categories. The number of equivalent quadrants surveyed for the 7 terrain and water classes defined in the terrain layer. The last layer we investigated was an intersection between the current ABMI soil layer with the classifications from the Terrain wetness sub-layer (dry, mesic, wet; soil moisture model). This allows for large polygons of a single soil class to be subdivided into more refined moisture regimes. However, this intersection also results in 21 habitat classes which we may be unable to successfully model. Due to the low sample size for the thin break along wetness category, we combined it into a single habitat class for a total of 19 habitat classes. The number of equivalent quadrants surveyed for the 8 soil and three moisture-based classes in the soil moisture layer. Using each land cover layer, we created SDMs for bryophytes, lichens, mites, and vascular plants. We only created models for species which currently have soil models that have been approved for publication on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser. Initially we modeled each species using only the most complex model (all land cover &amp; all footprint types). However, we consistently encountered convergence issues. To address this issue, we created a set of four models representing the most complex and simplest possible model sets (Table 1). This approach is not representative of our final model sets (i.e., multiple nested models), but should provide a general understanding on the benefits of alternative land cover layers. If multiple models converged, coefficients were weighted using an inverse weighted variance approach. Table 2.1: Broad definitions of candidate models.

On the other hand, model performance for some species declined substantially compared to soil-based model (e.g., vascular plants, cf. soil wetness model). On average, the number of models which improved were highest for using the soil moisture layer, and lowest using the land facet layer.

We did observe vertical bands in the correlation plots suggesting some ABMI sites with a consistent soil classification (e.g., 100% clay) were multiple land cover types using the alternative layers.

We visually assessed the discrimination power of the models vis-à-vis detection and found that the apparent difference in predicted probabilities between land cover layers largely did not reflect difference in detections.

However, there are coefficients which are not clustered appropriately. For example, the Other_Wet category clustered with human footprint features in the soil moisture model. These errors are often resolved when looking at the use-availability, so this could indicate that our simple modeling approach has issues with properly estimating certain coefficient types.

In addition, use-availability for the land facet (Appendix 1) and soil moisture layers (Appendix 2) and modeled coefficients (Appendix 3,4) for vascular plants are also available. "],["discussion.html", "4 Discussion 4.1 Possible path forward", " 4 Discussion Overall, the results of our model exploration are mixed. Though the soil moisture land cover layer appears to improve models for the majority of species, the gains in model fit are marginal. In addition, species with decreases in model performance often experienced larger declines than those with increasing model fit. We also did not observe large changes in the discrimination ability of models across the land cover layers. We might be able to resolve some of these issues by improving or modeling framework, but those improvements are not guaranteed. Another option for imroving the models is to use other data to augment and refine the existing complex soil polygon layer. Our geospatial experts identified soil layers available through Google Earth Engine that we could explore. They are raster-based layers (250m) and have provincial coverage, but they might have similar issues to our current soils layer. The soil textures class layer has similar categories to our current soils layer. Therefore, this layer could be used to refine the classification of complex polygons (e.g., multiple soil classes for a single polygon). In addition, we have a small number of unknown soils in our current layer (9 sites) which this new layer could help classify. 4.1 Possible path forward Accept the flaws in the alternative land cover layers, choose one, and move forward with creating the final modeling framework. Information like moisture potential is important for many species, and we could include this information in the space/climate section of our current soil-based models. Explore the Google Earth Engine layers and see if they can be used to improve our current soils layer information (particularly at ABMI sites) (https://www.openlandmap.org/#/?base=Stamen%20(OpenStreetMap)&amp;center=54.7834,-110.1490&amp;zoom=5.737560184630052&amp;opacity=40&amp;layer=sol_texture.class_usda.tt_m&amp;depth=0). Upon brief inspection the GEE layers seem promising for updating/refining our soil layer. Continue with a literature review to find an alternative layer that works across species groups. New GIS layers are constantly being developed. Therefore, we could perform another literature review to find a suitable replacement layer. (e.g., https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/adaptwest-landfacets/ Discuss what we want the land cover layer in the south to capture and how we would expect it to relative to species. Currently, we will not be moving forward with the land facet layer and will be exploring alternative layers as resources permit.
